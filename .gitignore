# The stage files and Portage snapshot in this repository have been pushed to the DS-Gentoo SourceForge page
# since they are too big to upload to GitHub (currently GitHub does not accept files greater than 100MB)
# If you want them you need to clone the DS-Gentoo SourceForge repository.
# The files were pushed to SourceForge in order to reduce the strain on Gentoo's official distribution server 
# (http://distfiles.gentoo.org/)

# Testing Files can be pulled using git clone ssh://maffblaster@git.code.sf.net/p/dsgentoo/code testing
